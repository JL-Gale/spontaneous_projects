# Spontaneous Projects

This is my collection of projects that I undertake spontaneously, whether to practice new skills or simply to alleviate boredom. 

This repository likely contains a variety of project types, including web and desktop applications, and whatever else I might learn over time.

Each project includes a README file that describes it in detail.
